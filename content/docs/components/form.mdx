Forms are tricky. They are one of the most common things you'll build in a web application, but also one of the most complex.

Well-designed HTML forms are:

- Well-structured and semantically correct.
- Easy to use and navigate (keyboard).
- Accessible with ARIA attributes and proper labels.
- Has support for client and server side validation.
- Well-styled and consistent with the rest of the application.
